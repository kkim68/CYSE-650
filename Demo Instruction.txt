[TARPIT CHECK]
1. As stated in the presentation, -sS scan is not affected by the tarpit.
   However, service discovery scans will be delayed a lot.
   Let's check if it really works. 

   (FROM KALI)
   There is no such host that has ip address of 10.0.2.50. It is just a tarpit that we configured.
   nmap -sV 10.0.2.50 -p 22,80,443 -Pn 

   However, if attacker conducts -sS scan, it will be captured by the Suricada IDS running in Bastion Host,
   and will be reported to Splunk automatically.
   nmap -sS 10.0.2.0/24 -p 1-1000 -Pn

2. check SIEM for log
